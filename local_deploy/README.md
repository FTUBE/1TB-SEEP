# Utilities to ease local deployment of SEEP

This utilities depend on tmux (tmux.sourceforge.net) which is an improved
version of GNU Screen IMHO with great scriptatility options. So you need to have
tmux installed to use these scripts. Of course, if you don't want to install
these, you can always deploy manually or create your own scripts.

I don't provide here instructions to install tmux. You can check tmux
documentation (which is pretty good) for specific platform instructions.
